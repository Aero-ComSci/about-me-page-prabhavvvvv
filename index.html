    <!--Three different positve character traits-->
    <p class="charactertraits">Energetic, quick-to-learn, ambitious</p>

<h2><u>My Narrative</u></h2>
<!--My Career Goals-->
<p class="firstparagraph">Aerospace. Artificial Intelligence. These are the two things constantly circling my mind at all times. <br> I dream it about it while sleeping, eating, and at school. My parents even wanted me to achieve this goal since I entered highschool. <br> However, achieving this goal without a solid foundatin or goal is not going to be easy. To achieve this goal, I will take AP and honors classes related <br> to this goal. Some of these classes include AP Chem, AP Calc BC, AP Stats, and many more. I will start taking AP classes my <br> sophmore year, and along with these classes, I will take other APs for college credit. In addition, I will take outside courses that will help me grasp the <br> fundamentals of space and artificial inelligence. Ultimately, I have decided that this would be my future because I have always been intrigued by the computer world, <br> artificial intelligence. It has always been my center of attention and I have wondered how robots work with human assistance. Aerospace has always <br> been a curiosity to me as well because I have always wondered how the Big Bang was formed. </p>
<br>

<!--My strengths and personal qualities-->
<p class="secondparagraph">Some characteristics that I posses are ambitious, perceptive, persistent, diplomatic, and cooperative. <br> All of these characteristics have been showed throughout my school career, and extracurriculars. I have been ambitous through my classes, always <br> striving to learn more and improve each day. Next, I have been perceptive of my own mistakes and have promised to learn from them, especially in <br> basketball games. In addition, I have been persistent by continuing to study even when I am feeling miserable to achive the best grade <br> I possibly can. Lastly, I have been diplomatic and cooperatve whenever a teacher or coach is teaching me new material. Even though <br> sometimes I do not want to hear a teacher's lecture, I cooperate as I know teachers know what is best for me. </p>
<br>

<!--Important achievments and work skils-->
<p class="thirdparagraph">Some activities that I have participated in during high school are basketball, a stock and investment club, <br> and starting a course dedicated to coding. I have also been researching about artificial intelligence and watching videos on space <br> to get more insight. Next, I have not achieved much from high school as I have just completed one semester of my freshman year. But, I did make the <br> basketball team and some of my accomplishments form middle school incude winning math awards, and trophies. In highschool, <br> personally a bg accomplishment was getting used to the environment as it much different from middle school. In addition, <br> I have learned many skills from my past experiences. I have learned to organize my work in a digital calendar, write down important due dates in my planner, and <br> how important it is to work in a team. Being on a team sport has always made me new friends and has introduced me to a new way of collaborating <br> with people I have just met this year. </p>
